# RegularExpression

[![Build Status](https://github.com/kddnewton/regular_expression/workflows/Main/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kddnewton/regular_expression/actions)
[![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/regular_expression.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/regular_expression)

A regular expression engine written in Ruby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "regular_expression"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install regular_expression

### Dependencies

#### Cranelift

One of the backends that the regular expression compiler can use is cranelift, which is a rust project with Ruby bindings handled by the `cranelift_ruby` gem. In order to use the compiler, you'll need to have `cargo` installed so that it can compile the rust native extension. On a Mac or Linux you can `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`. For other platforms, searching _install cargo_ can tell you how. Additionally, you'll need your Ruby to have been compiled with the `--enable-shared` option.

#### Capstone

To call `#disasm` on the generated machine code, you'll need Capstone installed. On a Mac you can `brew install capstone`, or on Ubuntu you can `sudo apt-get install libcapstone-dev`. For other platforms, searching _install capstone_ can tell you how.

#### Graphviz

To call `#to_dot` on the syntax tree or the state machines, or run the tests, you'll need Graphviz installed. On a Mac you can `brew install graphviz`, or on Ubuntu you can `sudo apt-get install graphviz`. For other platforms, searching _install graphviz_ can tell you how.

## Usage

To create a regular expression pattern, use:

```ruby
pattern = RegularExpression::Pattern.new("ab?c")
```

Patterns can be queried for whether or not they match a test string, as in:

```ruby
pattern.match?("abc") # => true
pattern.match?("ac") # => true
pattern.match?("ab") # => false
```

## Development

After [installing the dependencies](#dependencies) checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Status

At the moment we support most basic features, but there is a lot of ground left to cover. Some of them are written out in issues, while others are just documented here. Here is the current list as it stands:
