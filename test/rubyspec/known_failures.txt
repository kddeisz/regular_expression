disallows forward references >= 10
allows negative numeric backreferences
allows forward references
supports <n> (backreference to previous group match)
fails when trying to match a backreference to an unmatched capture group
regular numeric backreferences cannot start with 0
delimited numeric backreferences can start with 0
saves captures in numbered $[1-N] variables
named capture groups invalidate numeric backreferences
0 is not a valid backreference
can match an optional quote, followed by content, followed by a matching quote, as the whole string
allows numeric conditional backreferences
treats + or - as the beginning of a level specifier in \k<> backreferences and (?(...)...|...) conditional backreferences
will not clobber capture variables across threads
does not reset enclosed capture groups
resets nested <n> backreference before match of outer subexpression
allows either <> or '' in named conditional backreferences
saves match data in the $~ pseudo-global variable
allows + and - in group names and referential constructs that don't use levels, i.e. subexpression calls
allows access to back-references from the current level
treats subexpression calls as distinct from simple back-references
allows recursive subexpression calls
allows numeric subexpression calls
supports (?imx-imx:expr) (scoped inline modifiers)
supports . with /m
supports /m (multiline)
invokes substitutions for /o only once
supports modifier combinations
supports (?imx-imx) (inline modifiers)
supports /i (case-insensitive)
supports /x (extended syntax)
supports /o (once)
allow empty iterations in the middle of a loop
allow extra empty iterations
make the Regexp proceed past the quantified expression on failure
shouldn't cause the Regexp parser to get stuck in a loop
matches zero-width capture groups in optional iterations of loops
supports + (1 or more of previous subexpression)
handles incomplete range quantifiers
treats ? after {n} quantifier as another quantifier, not as non-greedy marker
supports {m,n}? (m to n of previous subexpression) - lazy)
lets us use quantifiers on assertions
supports * (0 or more of previous subexpression)
supports +? (0 or more of previous subexpression - lazy)
supports *? (0 or more of previous subexpression - lazy)
does not treat {m,n}+ as possessive
supports {m,n} (m to n of previous subexpression)
does not delete optional assertions
supports nested quantifiers
group names cannot start with digits or minus
raises a SyntaxError when parentheses aren't balanced
supports \Z (string end anchor, including before trailing \n)
supports (?!<) (negative lookbehind)
supports \z (string end anchor)
supports \A (string start anchor)
supports \b (word boundary)
supports (?<=) (positive lookbehind)
does not match ^ after trailing \n
supports (?!<\b) (negative lookbehind with word boundary)
supports (?<=\b) (positive lookbehind with word boundary)
supports $ (line end anchor)
supports ^ (line start anchor)
supports \B (non-word-boundary)
handles control escapes with \C-x syntax
supports the \K keep operator
handles three digit octal escapes starting with 0
support \x (hex characters)
support \c (control characters)
supports the \R line break escape
they're supported
gives precedence to escape sequences over substitution
allows interpolation which mixes modifiers
allows interpolation of literal regexps
throws RegexpError for malformed interpolation
allows escape sequences in interpolated regexps
